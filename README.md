# ThreeJSDemo
This repository contains a ThreeJS demo program which tests using verticies, lines and wireframes, importing textures and models, as well as experimenting with lighting and physics

In order to run this demo you must access ThreeJSDemo.html through an http address. The most straightforward way to do this is by running:

python -m http.server

in your terminal, and then navigating to the address shown in the terminal to search for the file

Controls:

Arrow Keys: Rotate around the center of the world

I, K: Pan up and down
J, L: Pan left and right
U, O: Zoom in and out

V: Show cube vericies
E: Show cube edges
F: Show cube faces

X: Enable rotation of cube in the X axis
Y: Enable rotation of cube in the Y axis
Z: Enable rotation of cube in the Z axis

1: Toggle showing rabbit
B: Enable rotation of rabbit in the X axis
N: Enable rotation of rabbit in the Y axis
M: Enable rotation of rabbit in the Z axis

G: Launch physics simulation mode

Physics simulation mode:
Slider 1: Select initial height of rabbit
Slider 2: Select gravitational strength of world
Slider 3: Select initial velocity in X axis
Slider 4: Select initial velocity in Z axis

P: Run physics simulation
